This folder contains the simulations data used for the calibration analysis performed in [notebooks/calibration.ipynb](../notebooks/calibration.ipynb).

If adding to it, please try to:
- follow the `date/model_name/` structure, where `date` corresponds to the most recent historical information made available to the model (use `YYYY_MM_DD` format).
- add a `README.md` file explaining how the data was obtained (even if only referencing existing READMEs).
