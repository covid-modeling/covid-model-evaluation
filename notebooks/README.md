These notebooks serve to illustrate usage of our code and to make our results reproducible. They can be viewed on GitHub or rerun locally using [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/).

**Warning**: We have made a best effort to add explanatory comments to these notebooks, but they should be considered a demonstration of our methodology rather than a completed product. Readers are encouraged to consult other sources and verify the data used before using these results in decision-making.

- `demo.ipynb`: illustrates the smooth / normalise / score approach and contains a basic example of how to do so using the [coveval](../coveval) modules.
- `calibrations.ipynb`: contains the code used to perform the analysis described in [link_to_blog_post](TODO) and to reproduce the figures in [figs](./figs/).
